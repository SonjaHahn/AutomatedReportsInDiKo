# AutomatedReportsInDiKo

This set of functions was created as part of the internal evaluation of project InDiKo (funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research) at the University of Education Karlsruhe. Specifically, they were used in R Markdown documents which allowed for a greater automatisation of the evaluation process.

What is uploaded here is an overview and explanation of the functions including their code and sample data. We encourage anyone to use and further develop them as you see fit.

We plan to release a package containing the functions, though this is a work in progress.
